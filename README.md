## Information Archtecture

### Ontology
This website is about kittens, particularly four different breeds. Each breed has a description of its look, color, and personality. The breeds are Ragdoll, Maine Coone, Persian, and Russian Blue.

### Taxonomy
* The homepage has a photo of multiple kittens and a brief welcome message. It also has a link the the Types of Kittens page
* On the Types of Kittens page there is a small bio for each of the four breeds. Each bio has a sentence about the breed's look, the breed's color, and the breed's personality. The end of the page invited the reader to sign up for the newsletter.
* The Join our Newsletter page allows the reader to enter their name and email to sign up for a newsletter about kittens.

### Choreography
* The title and subtitle of the website and the navigation appear at the top of each page of the website. This provides a sense of unity throughout.
* The homepage is organized in a Z-pattern
* The Types of Kittens page is organized in an F-pattern
* THe kittens on the types of kittens page are organized randomly with the picture with white backgrounds being spaced out so that they don't look odd right next to one another.

#### Z-Pattern:
* Primary optical area: title and subtite of the website
* Strong follow area: navigation
  * image placeholder between this and the next
* Weak follow area: brief welcome message
* Terminal area: click here to learn about different types of kittens

#### F-Pattern:
* Left to right: information about kittens is on the left with their photo on the right
* Photos break up monotony and draw the viewer's eye across the screen
* Text is short because users won't read most of it
* Look is first in each breed's description since it is probably the most important identifier of each breed


## Design Logic

### Z-Pattern:
* I chose to put the title and subtitle in the primary optical area because it is short, easy-to-read, and the first thing that people see when they look at the website.
* I chose to put the navigation in the strong follow area because it is important to see and viewers are used to seeing navigation at the top of a website.
* I chose to put an image placeholder in the middle of the screen since the eye scans over it nicely and it can be taken in easily without being studied.
* I chose to put a brief welcome message in the weak follow area because it is perhaps the least important content and is not super important so it is okay if the viewer doesn't pay much attention to it.
* I chose to put a link to the Types of Kitten webpage in the terminal area since it is the last thing that the viewer sees and it is the place of action. The goal of the website is to present information to the reader, so this is a good way to get the reader to dive into more info and the rest of the website.

### F-Pattern:
* I chose to lay out the F pattern with written information about each cat on the left and the photo on the right. This draws the viewer's eye across the screen.
* I gave each cat a name as an h2 and then a section on their look, color, and personality. Each of these sections are denoted by an h3. This makes the most important info, the breed, stand out. 
* The h3s help break up the information and make it easier to read and digest. It makes it easier to skim and understand quickly
* The order of the cats is determined in part by the background color of the photos. I made sure that the two photos with white background weren't right next to eachother because that could've looked weird.

## C.R.A.P. Principles

* Contrast: I used a light colored background so that the words would stand out against it. I also added a white background and border to images to make them really pop.
* Repitition: I used a color picker to choose a shade of blue found in the image on the homepage. I used this blue as the hover color for links and the navigation. Repeating the color provided a sense of coherency throughout the website. I kept the same title/navigation on each page to provide a unity throughout. I also used the same format for each of the bios of the different cat breeds.
* Alignment: On the homepage I algined the written words to the sides with the photo in the middle in order to effectively create the Z-pattern. I added margins so that the word's wouldn't be too close to the edge and would be readable. On the Types of Kittens page I aligned the content in the center of the screen with margins to make the information more readable. I also aligned the words to the left and the images to the right so that there was a sense of coherency and things would make sense to viewer as they read.
* Proximity: On the homepage, I added space between the line and the words/picture so that things weren't too close together. I made sure to add padding around the picture so that the words weren't too close to it. I also made sure there was plenty of space between the title and the navigation and between the welcome message and the link. This made it so that the words aren't too close together and allow the viewer's eye to properly scan the page. I made sure the line height was enough to make sure the words were easily legible. On the Types of Kittens page I added space between each breed so that they would be distinguishable from one another and not just seem like one giant page of information. Additionally, I added space between the different subheadings (Look, Color, and Personality) to set those apart from one another.

## Fonts
I chose the fonts that I did because they are fun and professional. I think the font is light-hearted and fun (reminiscent of a kitten's personality) but still professional enough to be taken seriously as an informative website. They actually happen to be the same fonts I used for my personal website, but I think it conveys the same sort of feeling for this website as it does for my personal website: fun but professional.
